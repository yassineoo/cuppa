Logging Levels
Logging levels in winston conform to the severity 
ordering specified by RFC5424: severity of all levels is assumed to
 be numerically ascending from most important to least important.
Each level is given a specific integer priority. 
The higher the priority the more important the message is considered to be,
 and the lower the corresponding integer priority. For example, as specified exactly 
 in RFC5424 the syslog levels are prioritized from 0 to 7 (highest to lower)
{
  emerg: 0,
  alert: 1,
  crit: 2,
  error: 3,
  warning: 4,
  notice: 5,
  info: 6,
  debug: 7
}
Similarly, npm logging levels are prioritized from 0 to 6 (highest to lowest):

{
  error: 0,
  warn: 1,
  info: 2,
  http: 3,
  verbose: 4,
  debug: 5,
  silly: 6
}
